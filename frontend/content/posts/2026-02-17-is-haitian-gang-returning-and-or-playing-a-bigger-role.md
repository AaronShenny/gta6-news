# Is Haitian Gang returning and/or playing a bigger role?

A dedicated fan on the GTA 6 subreddit has sparked discussion regarding the potential return and enhanced role of the Haitian gang in the upcoming title. The user emphasizes the gang's intrinsic connection to Vice City's cultural fabric, suggesting that their absence would render the game incomplete. Observations from early trailer visuals and screenshots hint at possible police interactions or raids in locations associated with the gang. The community is left to ponder whether the Haitians will feature prominently in the open world, engaging players if provoked, or if protagonists like Jason (and 'Brian' as mentioned by the user) will form alliances or rivalries with them over drug trade within the main story.

## Key Takeaways
