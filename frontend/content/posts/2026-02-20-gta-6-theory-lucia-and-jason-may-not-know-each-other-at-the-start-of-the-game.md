# GTA 6 Theory: Lucia and Jason May Not Know Each Other at the Start of the Game

A compelling fan theory challenges the popular assumption that Grand Theft Auto VI protagonists Lucia and Jason are already a couple when the game begins. Based on a re-examination of the first trailer and official character descriptions, the theory proposes that Lucia and Jason meet for the first time in prison. Key evidence includes the correctional officer's interaction with Jason, implying Jason's past criminal history rather than frequent visits to Lucia; their initial 'Hey' greeting suggesting surprise and instant attraction; and the official quote, 'Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him,' hinting at their initial encounter being a pivotal in-game event. The theory further analyzes the progression of their intimacy in dancing scenes, suggesting their relationship rapidly develops from strangers to a couple early in the game, supported by an ankle monitor visible in an intimate scene, placing it early in the narrative.

## Key Takeaways
- The theory posits Lucia and Jason are strangers who meet for the first time in prison at the start of GTA 6.
- The correctional officer's question to Jason ('You might’ve seen him before?') is reinterpreted as recognition from Jason's own past arrests as a teen, aligning with his character description as a former 'grifter and crook'.
- Lucia and Jason's initial 'Hey' greeting is viewed as immediate attraction and surprise rather than a reunion of a long-term couple.
- The official GTA VI website quote, 'Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him,' suggests their initial encounter is a significant in-game event, not a pre-existing relationship.
- The progression from Jason's shyness to dance at a bar to intimate dancing in a club implies a rapid development of their relationship during the early stages of the game.
- An intimate scene featuring Lucia's ankle monitor indicates it occurs early in the game, supporting the idea of a quickly evolving relationship from their initial meeting.
- Rockstar's history of manipulating trailers is cited, encouraging a fresh perspective on the presented narrative.
- The theory suggests their relationship quickly develops into a romantic one by the end of Chapter 1.

## FAQ
**What is the main theory regarding Lucia and Jason's relationship in GTA 6?**
The main theory suggests that Lucia and Jason do not know each other at the very beginning of GTA 6 and meet for the first time in prison.

**How does the correctional officer's interaction with Jason support this theory?**
When the CO asks Jason if he's seen him before, the theory proposes the CO recognizes Jason from his own past arrests as a teen, given Jason's background as a 'grifter and crook', rather than from Jason frequently visiting Lucia.

**What does the GTA 6 website quote 'Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him' imply?**
The quote implies that their 'meeting' is a pivotal event that occurs at the beginning of the game, rather than them already being in a long-standing relationship.

**How do the dancing scenes in the trailer contribute to the theory?**
The contrast between Jason's initial shyness to dance with Lucia and their later intimate club dancing suggests a rapid development of their relationship from strangers to a couple early in the game, rather than a reunion of an established pair.
