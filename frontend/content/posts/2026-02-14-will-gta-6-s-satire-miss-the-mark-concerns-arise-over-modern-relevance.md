# Will GTA 6's Satire Miss the Mark? Concerns Arise Over Modern Relevance

A discussion has emerged within the Grand Theft Auto community regarding the potential for GTA 6's satirical elements to feel dated upon release. Citing the game's lengthy development cycle since its 2023 trailer, a Reddit user expressed apprehension about how Rockstar Games will capture and satirize the rapidly evolving and often self-parodying nature of the 2020s.
