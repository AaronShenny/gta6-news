# GTA VI's "Loyalty Simulator" Theory: Jason's Infidelity Could Be a Tactical Nightmare

Recent discussions within the GTA 6 community suggest a groundbreaking 'Loyalty Simulator' mechanic could be central to the game's dynamic between protagonists Jason and Lucia. Drawing parallels to Rockstar's commitment to realism in titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, a Reddit user posits that engaging in 'side action' as Jason, such as visiting a strip club, won't be consequence-free. The theory outlines how elements like pervasive in-game social media, physical evidence (glitter, perfume, hickeys), and a potential 'Trust System' could lead to Lucia's AI reacting negatively. This could manifest as her withholding combat support, ignoring calls, or creating a tense psychological atmosphere, forcing players to meticulously plan their actions to avoid detection, akin to a professional hitman covering their tracks. The speculation raises questions about whether this potentially frustrating yet genius mechanic will define a new layer of immersion in GTA VI.

## Key Takeaways
