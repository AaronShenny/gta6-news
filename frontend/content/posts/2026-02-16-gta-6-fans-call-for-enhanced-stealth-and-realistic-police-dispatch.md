# GTA 6: Fans Call for Enhanced Stealth and Realistic Police Dispatch

A recent discussion on Reddit's r/GTA6 community highlights player desires for more robust and realistic gameplay mechanics in the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI. The original poster expressed dissatisfaction with GTA V's stealth system, noting its effectiveness primarily within missions and the unrealistic instant wanted levels incurred in free-roam, even in isolated areas. They propose implementing a witness system akin to Watch Dogs, where players can identify and neutralize NPCs attempting to call the police, thereby avoiding immediate wanted levels. Furthermore, the discussion calls for a more authentic police dispatch system, suggesting that law enforcement should scan areas to locate suspects rather than instantly locking onto their exact position, citing GTA V's behavior of cops tracking players directly above tunnels as an example of current system limitations.

## Key Takeaways
- Criticism of GTA V's stealth system for being mission-specific and unrealistic in free roam.
- Suggestion for a 'witness system' in GTA 6, similar to Watch Dogs, allowing players to prevent NPCs from alerting police.
- Demand for a more realistic police dispatch system where law enforcement scans areas instead of instantly knowing the player's location.
- Example of current dispatch issues in GTA V, where cops track players directly above tunnels.
