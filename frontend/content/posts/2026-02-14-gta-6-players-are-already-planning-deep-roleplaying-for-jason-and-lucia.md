# GTA 6 Players Are Already Planning Deep Roleplaying for Jason and Lucia

A recent Reddit discussion highlights a unique playstyle among Grand Theft Auto enthusiasts: meticulously keeping their in-game characters 'in character.' The author details their immersive approach in GTA V, where Michael De Santa had distinct vehicles for different aspects of his life, Franklin embraced flashy cars as 'new money,' and Trevor Philips maintained his iconic truck, with choices extending to clothing and weapons. This dedication to character authenticity even saw Michael's style shift dramatically during story events. Looking ahead to GTA 6, players are already strategizing how to apply this deep roleplaying to Jason and Lucia, speculating on their backgrounds—like Jason's potential ex-army status—to inform their in-game choices and foster a more cinematic gameplay experience.

## Key Takeaways
- Players engage in deep roleplaying, making in-game choices consistent with their characters' personalities and story arcs.
- Examples from GTA V include character-specific vehicle assignments (Michael's dual cars, Franklin's sports cars, Trevor's signature truck).
- Character authenticity extends to clothing, weapon choices, and adapting style based on story developments (e.g., Michael's 'Max Payne' phase).
- This immersive playstyle was also applied in Red Dead Redemption 2, ensuring Arthur Morgan's attire matched his environment and the period.
- Dedicated players are already planning similar in-character strategies for Jason and Lucia in GTA 6, speculating on their backstories to guide customization.
- The aim is to enhance the cinematic and narrative experience of open-world games.

## FAQ
**What does 'keeping characters in character' mean?**
It refers to a playstyle where players make in-game decisions regarding vehicles, clothing, weapons, and actions that are consistent with their character's personality, background, and current story context, rather than solely for gameplay advantage.

**How do players apply this to GTA V?**
Examples include Michael having distinct cars for family vs. 'shady' activities, Franklin upgrading to flashy vehicles as new money, and Trevor sticking to his signature, upgraded truck. Clothing and weapon choices also reflect their individual styles and story arcs, even adapting to plot developments.
