# GTA 6 Physical Release: Community Expresses Concerns Over Potential 'Code-in-Box' Strategy

A recent discussion within the GTA 6 community has highlighted significant concerns surrounding the potential physical release strategy for the highly anticipated title. A Reddit user pointed out a fear that Rockstar Games might opt for a 'code-in-the-box' model, where a physically purchased game box contains only a digital download code rather than a traditional game disc. This approach, previously seen with games like Fallout 76, has historically been met with disapproval from players who prefer tangible media, citing issues with game preservation, resale value, and reliable access without constant internet connectivity.

## Key Takeaways
- A Reddit post initiated a debate over GTA 6's physical release strategy.
- The primary concern is Rockstar potentially adopting a 'code-in-the-box' model for the physical edition.
- Fallout 76 is cited as a controversial precedent for this type of release.
- Players generally express a strong preference for traditional disc-based physical copies over digital codes in a box.
- The community worries about the implications for game ownership, preservation, and access.

## FAQ
**What is a 'code-in-the-box' physical release?**
It refers to a physical game package that contains only a digital download code for the game, instead of an actual game disc or cartridge.

**Why are GTA 6 fans concerned about this potential strategy?**
Fans often prefer traditional physical discs for reasons such as game preservation, the ability to resell or lend games, and not being reliant on digital storefronts or constant internet access to play the game.

**Has Rockstar Games used this model before for a major title?**
While Rockstar has offered digital versions, a 'code-in-the-box' for a flagship Grand Theft Auto title would represent a significant departure from their traditional physical releases, which typically include a game disc.
