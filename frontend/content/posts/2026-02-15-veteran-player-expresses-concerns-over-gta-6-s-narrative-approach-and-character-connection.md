# Veteran Player Expresses Concerns Over GTA 6's Narrative Approach and Character Connection

A dedicated Grand Theft Auto fan recently voiced concerns regarding the narrative direction of modern games, including potential implications for GTA 6. The player reminisced about the 'homey and cozy' feel of older titles like San Andreas and Vice City, where players experienced an 'organic journey' alongside characters like CJ, fostering genuine attachment. In contrast, they noted a trend in newer games, including GTA V, where protagonists are introduced into worlds with pre-existing relationships (e.g., Franklin and Lamar, Michael and Lester). This approach, described as 'getting dropped into chapter 5 of a book,' makes it difficult for players to form meaningful connections with characters they haven't 'met' through the protagonist's eyes. The author fears GTA 6 might follow this pattern, potentially diminishing the sense of discovery and personal investment that defined earlier installments.

## Key Takeaways
- Player expresses a growing detachment from modern game narratives, potentially due to personal growth or a shift in game design.
- Older GTA titles (San Andreas, Vice City, GTA IV) fostered character attachment through an 'organic journey' where players experienced relationships from the protagonist's initial perspective.
- Modern games often drop players into worlds with pre-existing character relationships, making it harder to connect (e.g., GTA V's Franklin/Lamar, Michael/Lester).
- This 'chapter 5' narrative approach diminishes player immersion and personal investment in the characters.
- Concerns are raised that GTA 6 might adopt a similar 'story before the story' structure, potentially impacting player connection and the sense of discovery.

## FAQ
**What is the main concern about GTA 6's narrative direction?**
The primary concern is that GTA 6 might introduce players into a story where the main characters already have pre-established relationships, making it harder for players to form their own connections and feel like they're embarking on an organic journey alongside the protagonist.

**How do older GTA games differ in their narrative approach, according to the player?**
Older GTA games like San Andreas allowed players to experience character relationships from the ground up, fostering a sense of discovery and personal attachment as the protagonist met and interacted with characters for the first time, creating a 'homey and cozy' feeling.

**Is this a common sentiment among Grand Theft Auto fans?**
While the article represents one player's personal perspective, the sentiment regarding narrative immersion, character development, and the impact of pre-established relationships is a frequently discussed topic within the wider gaming community.
