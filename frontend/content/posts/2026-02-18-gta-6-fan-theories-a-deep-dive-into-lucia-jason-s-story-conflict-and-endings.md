# GTA 6 Fan Theories: A Deep Dive into Lucia & Jason's Story, Conflict, and Endings

A popular fan theory for Grand Theft Auto 6 outlines a detailed narrative arc for protagonists Lucia and Jason. It suggests an opening where Lucia begins in prison with an ankle monitor, while Jason is introduced as a military or car/gun enthusiast. Their personalities are presented as polar opposites: Lucia as the dominant, crime-driven thrill-seeker aiming for a lavish lifestyle, and Jason as the reluctant, laid-back partner desiring a quiet life. The theory posits they knew each other before the game, with Lucia potentially using Jason initially but developing genuine feelings, influenced by a confirmed in-game relationship bar. The central conflict is envisioned as a conspiracy involving corrupt, 'Tenpenny-like' police running a major crime syndicate, who begin hunting Lucia and Jason after a job goes awry. Finally, the theory speculates on multiple endings à la GTA 5, including scenarios where players might kill one or both protagonists, or a 'Deathwish' option leading to either a 'Bonnie and Clyde' style demise or a triumphant escape into the sunset.

## Key Takeaways
- The game's opening may feature Lucia in prison with an ankle monitor, while Jason is introduced separately in a military or car/gun-focused tutorial.
- Lucia is theorized to be the dominant, crime-loving partner seeking luxury, contrasting with Jason's reluctant, laid-back, and quiet disposition.
- Their relationship is believed to pre-date the game, with Lucia potentially using Jason initially but developing genuine affection, influenced by in-game choices.
- The primary conflict could involve corrupt 'Tenpenny-like' police operating a crime syndicate, who pursue Lucia and Jason after a significant robbery.
- Multiple endings are speculated, similar to GTA 5, offering choices to eliminate Lucia, Jason, or both, or a 'Deathwish' scenario with outcomes ranging from a joint 'Bonnie and Clyde' death to a successful escape.
