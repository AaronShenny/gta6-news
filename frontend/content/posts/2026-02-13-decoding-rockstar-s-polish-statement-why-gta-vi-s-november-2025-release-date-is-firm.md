# Decoding Rockstar's 'Polish' Statement: Why GTA VI's November 2025 Release Date is Firm

Following Rockstar Games' recent announcement regarding Grand Theft Auto VI's November 2025 release, citing the need for the 'level of polish you have come to expect,' a gaming enthusiast has analyzed the developer's past use of the term 'polish' in delay statements. The analysis suggests that when Rockstar uses 'polish,' it indicates a game is in its final development stages, and historically, titles have launched without further delays after such an announcement. This pattern, observed with major releases like Red Dead Redemption (2010), Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), and Grand Theft Auto V (2013), points to the November 2025 window for GTA VI being a firm target, barring the unique circumstances of a PC port.

## Key Takeaways
- Rockstar's November 2025 statement for GTA VI mentioned achieving the "level of polish you have come to expect."
- Historically, Rockstar has used "polish" in delay announcements to signify games are in their very final development stages.
- Previous console titles delayed for "polish" (RDR1, RDR2, GTA V) launched without further delays, typically within 2-8 months of the announcement.
