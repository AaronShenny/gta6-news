# GTA 6 Map Design Debate: Endless Land vs. Traditional Island Border

A recent Reddit post ignited a discussion about the potential design of GTA 6's northern map border. While some players reportedly advocate for an 'endless', procedurally generated landscape, the original poster expresses a strong preference for the traditional island design. This preference stems from the belief that a defined island allows Rockstar to incorporate more unique and engaging underwater secrets and mysteries, offering a richer player experience compared to potentially bland, infinite terrain. The author suggests both approaches have their 'unimmersive' aspects, but the island design offers more scope for distinctive content.
