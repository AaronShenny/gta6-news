# GTA 6's Staggering Budget: Is a $70 Price Tag Enough to Justify a $2.5 Billion Investment?

A recent viral Reddit post from u/CabinReddit has ignited significant discussion within the gaming community by drawing a sharp contrast between the estimated budget of Grand Theft Auto 6 and its predecessor, GTA 5, alongside their respective launch prices.

However, the estimated base game price for GTA 6 is projected to be $70, only a 16.67% increase from GTA 5's $60. This stark disparity has led many to question how Rockstar Games plans to recoup such a monumental investment with only a modest increase in the game's retail price, sparking debate about GTA 6's potential financial success relative to GTA 5 and highlighting the escalating costs of AAA game development.
