# GTA 6's Gloriana: Unpacking the Mystery of the Bordering State

A recent discussion on the GTA 6 subreddit has sparked intriguing speculation regarding 'Gloriana,' a bordering state explicitly mentioned in connection with the upcoming game. Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto titles where neighboring territories were largely implied or distant, the direct mention of Gloriana in GTA 6 has caught the attention of players. Reddit user u/mdelgado73 suggests that Gloriana might function similarly to a recurring, unseen character in a TV show – known to exist and integral to the plot, but never directly visited. This could mean items to steal originate there, characters might flee to or from it, or it could simply provide narrative context. The theory posits that while players might witness the border, an in-game mechanic could prevent direct access to Gloriana, fueling its enigmatic presence within the game's world.

## Key Takeaways
- GTA 6 is the first game to explicitly mention a direct bordering state: Gloriana.
- Previous GTA titles (IV, V) only referenced distant, non-bordering locations.
- Speculation suggests Gloriana will be an unseen but narratively significant element, similar to a character often mentioned but never shown.
- Gloriana could serve various plot purposes, such as being the source of missions or a refuge for characters.
- A game mechanic might allow players to see the border but prevent entry into Gloriana.
