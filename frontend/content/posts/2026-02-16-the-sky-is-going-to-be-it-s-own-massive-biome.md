# The sky is going to be it's own massive biome

According to a recent discussion, Grand Theft Auto 6 is set to revolutionize aerial gameplay by transforming its sky into a 'massive biome,' a stark contrast to the largely empty and static airspace of GTA 5. Building on hints from Red Dead Redemption 2's cloud technology, GTA 6 is expected to feature an insane degree of weather realism, including heavy storms, lightning, and wind that will not only affect visibility but also dynamically impact aircraft handling. Beyond environmental effects, the sky will reportedly be a populated space, teeming with NPC planes, helicopters, passenger jets, other online players, and, crucially, enemy aircraft from drug cartels, military, and police, promising dynamic aerial chases and combat. The article also speculates on the inclusion of random events and easter eggs, suggesting the sky will offer its own depth and gameplay opportunities.

## Key Takeaways
- GTA 5's sky was a largely empty and undynamic space for flying.
- GTA 6 is expected to transform the sky into a dynamic, populated 'biome' with significant depth.

- The sky may feature its own random events and easter eggs, potentially including alien sightings during storms.
- Flight mechanics will be more dynamic and engaging due to weather effects, wind, and air traffic.
