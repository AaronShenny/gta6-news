# Jason/Lucia. Killing people.

A discussion on Reddit's r/GTA6, initiated by user /u/f1uke55l, explores a potential disconnect between the perceived characterizations of Grand Theft Auto VI's protagonists, Jason and Lucia, and the series' traditional high-kill mission structures. The user expresses difficulty in visualizing either character as 'outright killers' based on their current presentation, arguing that previous Rockstar protagonists' violent actions were often easier to rationalize. The post suggests that if the game maintains a high frequency of lethal missions, it could feel inconsistent with the characters' implied 'normal' backgrounds. Drawing a comparison to Red Dead Redemption 2, the user advocates for a more grounded gameplay experience, emphasizing dialogue-heavy missions, mundane criminal activities (like disposing of vehicles or drug runs), and making major violent encounters less frequent but more impactful, with significant consequences such as needing to evade law enforcement or alter appearances. The discussion anticipates a potential divide between a story focused on character authenticity and a player base expecting classic, action-heavy 'GTA vibes'.
