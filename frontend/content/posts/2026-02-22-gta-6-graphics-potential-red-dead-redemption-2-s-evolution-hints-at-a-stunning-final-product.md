# GTA 6 Graphics Potential: Red Dead Redemption 2's Evolution Hints at a Stunning Final Product

A recent Reddit post by u/someonesleeping on the r/GTA6 subreddit has sparked considerable discussion by drawing an exciting parallel between the graphical evolution of Red Dead Redemption 2's early trailers and its eventual release, offering a glimpse into Grand Theft Auto VI's potential. The post highlights how RDR2's second trailer, released a year and a month before its October 2018 launch, and its third trailer, released five months prior, showcased visuals that, while impressive for their time, were notably less refined than the finished product. By illustrating the "night and day" difference observed in RDR2's character models, the author posits that if GTA 6's current visual state (presumably from its initial reveal trailer, roughly a year and a half before its projected release) is already striking, the finished game's graphics could be truly unimaginable.

## Key Takeaways
- Red Dead Redemption 2's second trailer was released 13 months before the game's October 2018 launch.
- RDR2's third trailer was released 5 months before the game's launch.
- Significant graphical improvements, described as "night and day," were observed between RDR2's early trailers and its final release, especially in character models.
- The post speculates that if GTA 6's current visuals (implied to be from its initial trailer, approximately 1.5 years before release) are already impressive, the final product's graphics will be exceptionally stunning.
