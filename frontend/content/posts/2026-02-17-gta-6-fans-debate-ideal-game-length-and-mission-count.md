# GTA 6: Fans Debate Ideal Game Length and Mission Count

A recent Reddit post initiated a discussion on the ideal length for the upcoming Grand Theft Auto VI. The original poster, u/Munkadunk667, referenced Red Dead Redemption 2's extensive 109 core story missions across six chapters and an epilogue as a benchmark. While expressing a desire for more missions than RDR2, the user strongly emphasized the importance of mission quality over sheer quantity, specifically hoping to avoid an abundance of repetitive 'drive here to pick that up' objectives, even acknowledging the irony given the franchise title.
