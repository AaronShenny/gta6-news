# GTA 6 Pacing Analysis: Why Vice City's Return Might Be Slower and More Tactical Than Expected

Recent analysis of leaked GTA 6 footage, specifically the Hanks Waffles robbery sequence, strongly suggests a significant shift towards a slower, more tactical gameplay pace compared to previous Grand Theft Auto titles. Drawing inspiration from Red Dead Redemption 2, the game appears to emphasize deliberate actions, evidenced by numerous on-screen UI elements, context-sensitive commands for NPC and partner interactions, and a more nuanced police response system. This departure from immediate chaos indicates a deeper, more strategic approach to heists and encounters, requiring players to consider their actions more carefully.

## Key Takeaways
- Robberies may feature a 'Time until Cops dispatched' mechanic, allowing for strategic escapes rather than instant wanted levels.
- Advanced partner commands, such as 'Tap R1 to Check In With Jason, or Hold for more options,' suggest deeper tactical control over your companion.
- Context-sensitive UI buttons for 'rob,' 'threaten,' 'restrain,' and 'loot' indicate a richer interaction system with NPCs.
- Police responses appear more nuanced, with potential for surrender or delayed engagement even after violent acts, hinting at complex police interaction menus.
- Warnings like 'Any vehicle you are seen entering will be known by the law' add a layer of consequence to vehicle choices during escapes.
- A speculated weapon trunk system could limit on-person carrying capacity, further contributing to a more deliberate gameplay pace.
