# Eagle-Eyed Fans Dissect GTA 6 Trailer for Early Graphical Glitches

The highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI trailer has been under intense scrutiny by the dedicated gaming community, with Reddit user /u/AFKInACutscene compiling a detailed list of perceived 'mistakes' and graphical oversights. From minor texture issues and clipping problems to environmental oddities and character model imperfections, fans are meticulously dissecting every frame. While many of these observations point to common development-stage bugs, often ironed out before release, they highlight the immense anticipation and the community's keen eye for detail.

## Key Takeaways
- Missing textures on various objects.
- Tires appearing in perfect condition despite implied impacts.

## FAQ
