# GTA 6 at 30fps: Unacceptable When GTA 5 Hits 60?

A passionate Reddit user from the r/GTA6 community has sparked debate by arguing that a 30 frames per second (fps) target for Grand Theft Auto VI on the PlayStation 5 is 'not good enough,' especially when its predecessor, GTA V, can achieve near 60fps with Ray Tracing Performance mode on the same console. The user posits two main scenarios: either Rockstar Games delivers a 60fps mode for GTA VI on the standard PS5, or, more likely, reserves such a performance mode for the rumored PS5 Pro, a move that could potentially explain development timelines.

## Key Takeaways
- GTA V achieves near 60fps with RT Performance on PS5, setting a high bar for its successor.
- A 30fps target for GTA VI on base PS5 is considered unacceptable by some players, feeling like a downgrade.
- Two potential outcomes for GTA VI's frame rate: Rockstar optimizes for 60fps on base PS5, or a 60fps mode becomes a PS5 Pro exclusive feature.
- The PS5 Pro exclusivity theory is suggested as a possible explanation for development delays or specific performance targets.

## FAQ
**Why is 30fps for GTA 6 considered a problem?**
The sentiment is that if GTA V can run close to 60fps on PS5 (with RT Performance), then GTA VI, as a next-generation title, should at least match that, making 30fps feel insufficient or a step backward.

**What are the proposed solutions for GTA 6's frame rate?**
The article suggests either Rockstar achieving a 60fps mode on the base PS5 through optimization, or offering it exclusively on a more powerful console like the rumored PS5 Pro.

**How might the PS5 Pro tie into GTA 6's performance?**
The theory posits that a 60fps mode for GTA VI might be a key selling point for the PS5 Pro, potentially influencing Rockstar's development targets and release timing.
