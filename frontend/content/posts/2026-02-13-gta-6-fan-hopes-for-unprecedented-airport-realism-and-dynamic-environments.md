# GTA 6: Fan Hopes for Unprecedented Airport Realism and Dynamic Environments

A dedicated GTA fan, /u/Cakeyhands, has voiced a strong desire for Grand Theft Auto 6 to feature a vastly improved and more realistic airport experience compared to its predecessor. While GTA 5's world felt groundbreaking at the time, the user points to Red Dead Redemption 2 as setting a new standard for environmental detail and societal replication. The hope is for GTA 6's airport to be a living, breathing hub, complete with full interiors, dynamic security checkpoints, bustling check-in queues, scheduled flights, and hundreds of NPCs actively engaging in the travel process, from boarding planes to collecting luggage. Ultimately, the detailed environment would serve to enhance player interaction, even if that interaction involves causing chaos.

## Key Takeaways
- GTA 5's airport felt lacking compared to real-world airports and RDR2's environmental detail.
- Desire for a fully explorable airport interior in GTA 6.
- Hope for dynamic elements like security checks, check-in queues, and scheduled flights.
- Expectation of hundreds of NPCs actively participating in the airport's operations (boarding, disembarking, luggage handling).
- Inclusion of realistic airport elements: transfer buses, busy taxi lanes, baggage handlers, and internal shops.
- The ultimate goal is to provide a more detailed and interactive sandbox for player activities.
