# GTA 6 Grenade Overhaul: A Call for Fragmentation and Tactical Variety

A discussion originating from a Reddit post highlights a compelling idea for Grand Theft Auto 6's grenade mechanics. The core suggestion is to evolve grenades beyond simple high-explosive fireballs, proposing that they default to fragmentation. This change would be coupled with a system allowing players to select various grenade types, such as high explosive, stun, and smoke, mirroring the tactical depth seen in Red Dead Redemption 2's ammo selection. The proposal emphasizes limited carrying capacity for each grenade type, encouraging strategic choices in combat scenarios.

## Key Takeaways
- Grenades in GTA 6 should default to fragmentation effects.
- Players should have the ability to select different grenade types (e.g., high explosive, stun, smoke).
- The selection mechanism should be similar to choosing ammo types in Red Dead Redemption 2.
- Each grenade type would have a limited carrying capacity, promoting tactical resource management.
