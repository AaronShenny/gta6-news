# GTA 6 Fan Theory Suggests Tragic Liberty City Prologue for Lucia

A speculative theory posted by Reddit user u/PineappleFluffy7766 suggests a dramatic opening for Grand Theft Auto VI. Drawing parallels to the prologues of GTA V (North Yankton) and Red Dead Redemption 2 (Guarma), the user believes GTA 6 will kick off with protagonist Lucia in Liberty City. The theory posits Lucia will attempt a bank robbery to support her baby, an endeavor that goes awry, resulting in her arrest, separation from her child, and subsequent transfer to a prison in Vice City. This narrative would establish her character and connection to the main Vice City setting from the very beginning.
