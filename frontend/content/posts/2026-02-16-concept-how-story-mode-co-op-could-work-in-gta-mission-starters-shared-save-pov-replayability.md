# Concept: How story-mode co-op could work in GTA (mission starters, shared save, POV replayability)

A dedicated GTA fan has put forth an intriguing concept for integrating story-mode co-op into future Rockstar titles, particularly with GTA 6's anticipated dual protagonists. The core idea allows 2-3 friends to experience the main narrative together, each controlling a primary character. This system would utilize a shared, hosted story save, distinct from single-player, enabling free-roam and side activities between missions. To preserve Rockstar's signature cinematic storytelling, mission triggers would be character-specific; the player whose character's POV initiates a cutscene would start the mission, with others receiving prompts to join when their characters become relevant to the narrative. This approach aims to maintain story integrity, enhance replayability through varied character perspectives, make the world feel more dynamic, and add social value to customization, all while preserving a separate solo experience.
